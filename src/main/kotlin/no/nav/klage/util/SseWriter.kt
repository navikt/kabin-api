/**
 * Writes server-sent events to a [HttpServletResponse].
 *
 * The response is only touched on the first [send]: as long as nothing has been sent, [hasStarted] is
 * false and the caller can still let the normal error handling produce a regular (problem detail)
 * response body.
 *
 * Once the first event has been sent, a comment is written every [HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL] to keep the
 * connection alive and to notice a client that has gone away, even while the caller is busy doing
 * something that takes minutes. Remember to [close] the writer when done.
